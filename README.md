Welcome to the Diner Data Dive GitHub repository! This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from Danny's Diner to provide comprehensive insights into customer behaviors, menu item performance, and overall business operations.

- **Menu**: Details of menu items, including product IDs, product names, and prices.
- **Members**: Information about the diner's membership program, including customer IDs and join dates.
